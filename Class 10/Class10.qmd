# 1. Intro to PDB
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data_summary <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)

data_summary
```


## Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
There are 183,201 protein structures and UniProt has 251600768 protein sequences.

```{r}
round(183201/251600768*100, 2)
```
Approximately 7% of proteins have structures - although I don't know that this accounts for multiple structures of the same protein. 

```{r}
# Write function to remove comma from numeric 
toNumeric<- function(x) {
  x_strip <- gsub(",", "", x)
  
  as.numeric(x_strip)
}

# Check how numeric works
toNumeric("10,000")
```

```{r}

# Create a new df, numeric_data with the numeric data
numeric_data <- data.frame(lapply(data_summary, FUN = toNumeric), row.names = rownames(data_summary))

numeric_data

```

```{r}

sum(numeric_data$X.ray,numeric_data$EM) / sum(numeric_data$Total) * 100

```
93% of structures are solved by EM and X-Ray. 

## Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?
```{r}
sum(numeric_data[1:3,7])/sum(numeric_data$Total) * 100
```
98% of structures are protein. 

## Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
I did a sub-query for "protease" and selected proteins only and got 1603 structures. 


# 2. Visualizing HIV protease

## Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?
There are no hydrogens displayed in this structure because the resolution was not high enough to resolve hydrogen.

![HSG image with critical water and both side chains](1HSG_prettier.png)

## Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have
This is HOH 308.

#3. Intro to Bio3D
```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```


```{r}
pdb
```
## Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
198 amino acid residues. 

## Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
HOH and MK1.

## Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
2.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk

```
```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
